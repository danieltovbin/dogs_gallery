# Dogs Gallery Project
This project, Dogs Gallery, was originally developed as part of an assignment for our course at Int-College while learning React. It is a React application that showcases different dog breeds using cards and includes a search functionality. The project is built with React and TypeScript, and it fetches dog images from the Dog CEO API. Recently, I have made several updates to the project, including adding new features, improving responsiveness, and cleaning up the codebase.

# Features
Dog Breed Cards: Display information and images for various dog breeds.
Search Functionality: Users can search for dog breeds by typing in letters. The search feature will filter and display breeds that start with the entered letters.
Card Navigation: Clicking on a dog breed card navigates to a new page specific to that breed where users can chat.

# Tools and Technologies
React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
SCSS: Syntactically Awesome Style Sheets for enhanced styling.
BEM: Block Element Modifier methodology for naming CSS classes.
MUI: Material-UI library for React components.
Dog CEO API: Source of the dog breed images.
